Mobile Benchmarks - iOS Native, Android Native, Xamarin (iOS, Android)

This is a repository for housing apps that can show performance benchmarks across device platforms (iOS vs Android) and technologies (Native vs Xamarin [vs PhoneGap... future?]).

# Benchmarks

## Prime Numbers

__Find all the prime numbers from 1 to 100,000__

This benchmark uses two different implementations of a similar algorithm.  One uses math functions like `ceiling` and `sqrt` whereas the other uses only native math operators.  Using these two different algorithms can help tease out different performance characteristics.
